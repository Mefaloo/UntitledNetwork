  <h2>Democracy</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p><b>What is UntitledNetwork?</b>
<p>Democracy
<br>At UntitledNetwork strive to give everybody the best experience. In
order to achieve this we have an indirect democracy in place as mentioned earlier. In this
page we are going to take a deeper look at the inner workings of this system.
<br><br>The reason we have an indirect democracy rather than a direct one is because we feel having a
poll on every choice we make behind the scenes does not only make the development process
of our network extremely slow due to the 48 hour vote period, it also bothers the voters with
frequent pings. We feel having an elected representative would be the best solution to both of
these problems.
<br><br>The elected community representative is called "The President". The president is elected by
the community every two weeks at Sunday 1PM EST, currently this is done through discord
reactions. The admin hosting the election will be in charge of adding names to the President
elects. If a member is not on the list and seems as if they would do a good job, another
member is expected to tag the person they would like to see elected President a discord
channel named #PresidentElect along with a tag to the admin hosting the election.
Two days after the election got started, the voting is put to a stop and the new president gets
assigned their new role and the previous president gets their role removed. (Maybe replace
with an Ex-President role in the future)
<br><br>The President can serve as many terms as he is elected in. Unless they break the rules during
their term. Breaking rules as President will cost you the ability to be re-elected. After a recent
ban you can not be elected President for 4 times the length of the ban. Meaning that if you
were banned for 1 week you can not be elected president for 4 weeks.
<br><br>If decisions are considered eligible by the President and an Admin, they can be decided upon
in a public poll. These polls work similar to the elections and work with a majority.
We try not to stop any choices which were voted for by the community, however in some cases
there might be need for intervention by staff. Examples of choices that will be stopped are:
<br>1. Choices that give the president more power or a higher chance at getting reelected.
<br>2. Choices that otherwise interfere with the democracy.
<br>3. Choices that are financially or technically unreasonable or unrealistic.
<br><br>The President can be impeached if a poll vote by an admin makes it obvious people do not
approve of the president's behavior, the President gets demoted. After the impeaching of the
President we temporarily go without President until the poll for reelection is two days old.
<br><br>Server resets are the most controversial votes that exist, thus a server reset needs approval of
the President, the entire admin team-1 and the poll regarding the reset needs to have at least
75% of votes in favor of a reset.<p>

<div id="Rules" class="w3-container city w3-animate-opacity" style="display: none;">
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <p>These rules override the rules in the /rules command. If you have any questions or concerns about these rules please contact us via discord. If you follow these rules perfectly you will not be punished. In case you do get punished and you know for what but you werenâ€™t violating rules, create a punishment appeal explaining how your actions did not violate the rules.
   <br>If you are punished for breaking rules, you are still allowed to appeal.</p> 
  <button onclick="myAccFunc('rule1')" class="w3-padding-16 w3-theme w3-button w3-block w3-left-align">Do not discriminate</button>
  <p>
  <div id="rule1" class="w3-hide">
  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>This rule does not apply to discrimination based on anything directly related to the game. For example not allowing someone into your base because they have the color green in their skin is allowed. What is not allowed is saying things such as "Transgender people are not allowed in my base". Using slurs is also strictly forbidden.
<br> 
<br>Any form of discrimination will be met with a ban.</p>

  <button onclick="myAccFunc('rule2')" class="w3-padding-16 w3-theme w3-button w3-block w3-left-align">Do not threaten people</button>
  <p>
  <div id="rule2" class="w3-hide">
  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>Making threats to harm yourself or another person is not allowed. Making threats to break rules could is also not allowed. If the threats are actually followed up (for example you actually release someone's personal information without their permission) you could get permanently banned.</p>
	</div></p>
	</div>
  <button onclick="myAccFunc('rule3')" class="w3-padding-16 w3-theme w3-button w3-block w3-left-align">Do not use inappropriate names or Nicknames</button>
  <p><div id="rule3" class="w3-hide">
  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>Having an inappropriate name or nickname will get you punished depending on the name or nickname. For example having the name "Adolf Hitler" will get you a ban for discrimination.  If you join the server with an inappropriate name your nickname will be set for you and we will recommend you change your name as soon as possible. Setting your nickname to something inappropriate is worse because you are supposed to know the rules well enough by the time you get permission to change your nickname.
